# Term 4

## General information
In this portfolio you can find folders which are created for weekly exercises, weekly projects and for final project. 
There are 4 folders named week {1-4}, where you can find all the progress and work which has been done for that week.

Each week has `./mini-projects` and `./test/demo` folders. In `mini-projects` folder you can find all the completed exercises. 
Some of the mini-projects include additional features and functionality. In `demo` folder you can find all the "demos". These are
basically the example codes, that are provided by lecturers but enhanced further by me, to understand the logic better.  

Additionally, there is a `./projects` folder which include all the projects, such as `Nim`, `Lunar Radar`, `Simon Says` and 
`Morse Trainer`. Each projects is written in its appropriate named C file. 

Finally, there is `GHero` folder which is a source folder for guitar hero project. You can find the source code in 
`./GHero/src/main.c`


## Libraries 

You can find all the libraries in `./lib` folder. There are 8 libraries, each in their respective packages.
In each of the library folder there is appropriate header filer. By checking header you will see which methods were required by 
different exercises and which are created additionally by me. Most of the libraries are interconnected, which means that some 
libraries functions are used to define other libraries functions.

You can find more detailed information about each folder in this portfolio by checking their respective `README.md` files.
